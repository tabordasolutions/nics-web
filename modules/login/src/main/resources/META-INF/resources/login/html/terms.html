                        <h3>PURPOSE:</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide a clear statement to all users of the Situation Awareness &
                            Collaboration Tool (SCOUT) and the responsibility of those using SCOUT to protect information and use the
                            system properly.</p>
                        <h3>SCOPE &amp; APPLICATION</h3>
                        <p>This policy applies to all those who are granted access to SCOUT including, but not limited to, employees of the
                            Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, employees of the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE),
                            participating agencies, and all other authorized users.</p>
                        <h3>RESTRICTIONS ON USE</h3>
                        <p>Use must be legal, ethical, and not detrimental to the goals, mission, objectives, and reputation of Cal OES,
                            CALFIRE, or the State of California. Users may not:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Use the Portal in violation of applicable local, state, national laws, rules, and regulations.</li>
                            <li>Use the Portal to upload, transmit, or otherwise distribute any content that is unlawful or unprofessional.</li>
                            <li>Distribute information contained within the Portal without authorization.</li>
                            <li>Mine the portal to obtain user data.</li>
                            <li>Use any automated device or manual process to monitor or gather any data from the Portal or its users in
                                any manner inconsistent with the agency’s public safety mission.</li>
                            <li>Create multiple user accounts or create user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent
                                pretenses.</li>
                            <li>Permit anyone to access the Portal using the User’s credentials.</li>
                            <li>Use the Portal for any fraudulent or inappropriate purpose.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>ENFORCEMENT, AUDITING, AND REPORTING</h3>
                        <p>Anyone accessing SCOUT who has reasonable belief that another individual or entity is accessing SCOUT in
                            violation of this policy must report such activity to the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. Violation of
                            this policy may result in the revocation of access to SCOUT. Violators of this Agreement will be held
                            accountable to the greatest extent permitted by law.  State employees who violate this Agreement may be
                            subjected to discipline up to and including termination.</p>
                        <h3>SCOUT USER AGREEMENT</h3>
                        <p>User acknowledges, has read and understands, and hereby agrees to abide by the SCOUT Acceptable Use Agreement
                            set forth above.</p>
                        <p>User understands that as a SCOUT user, user may have access to confidential and/or protected information controlled
                            by state and federal law.  All access to the SCOUT system and any type of protected information obtained through
                            SCOUT is based on a “need to know” and the “right to know.”  Misuse of such information may adversely affect an
                            individual’s right to privacy, civil liberties, and civil rights, and violates constitutional and state law and/or
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>"Need to know” means you have a legitimate business purpose in accessing the information. "Right to know" means
                            you have legal authority pursuant to both law and department policy to access the information. To access
                            information, the "need to know" and the "right to know" must exist at the same time.
                            User understands that the unauthorized or improper use of SCOUT may amount to a violation of California Penal
                            Code section 502, as well as other state and federal laws.</p>
